About this app:
As we go through our lives automatic thoughts come into our conciseness. Many of these are unpleasant, unhelpful, and untrue. We often just accept them because we thought them. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is one of the most studied and successful forms of therapy, gets us think critically about what we are saying to ourselves and associate new thoughts with these automatic thoughts.
My idea is to harness the ability of computer games to create associations between stimulus and response to install the new associations of CBT.
